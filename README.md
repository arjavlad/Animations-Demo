# SwiftUI Circular Wave Animation

A mesmerizing SwiftUI animation that creates an illusion of circular motion using oscillating circles. This project demonstrates the power of SwiftUI's animation system combined with mathematical calculations to create smooth, continuous motion.

## Demo

## Features

- Dynamic number of circles (2-32)
- Smooth circular wave motion effect
- Real-time control over the number of circles
- 60fps animation using SwiftUI Timer
- Maintains perfect circular spacing between elements

## How It Works

The animation creates a circular wave effect by:

1. Positioning circles evenly around a central point
2. Using cosine functions to calculate radial oscillations
3. Continuously updating the phase to create motion
4. Ensuring even spacing regardless of the number of circles

This creates a smooth oscillating motion that, when combined with proper positioning and timing, creates the illusion of circular movement.
